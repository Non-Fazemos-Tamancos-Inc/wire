# Project Milestone 1

The most common use of mockups in software development is to create user interfaces that show the end-user what the software will look like without having to build the software or the underlying functionality. UI mockups can range from very simple hand-drawn screen layouts, through realistic bitmaps, to semi-functional user interfaces developed in a software development tool.

Foremost plan and layout for the final project frontend, backend and database

1.  Requirements: The requirements are given in the assignment, but you have to add any new requirements needed by your particular store implementation.
The system must have 2 types of users: Clients and Administrators
    
Administrators are responsible for registering/managing administrators, customers, and products/services provided. The application already comes with an account admin with password admin.

Customers are users who access the system to buy products/services.

The admin record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email.

Each customer's record includes, at least: name, id, address, phone, email

Product/services records include, at least: name, id, photo, description, price, quantity (in stock), quantity sold.

Your store may sell products, services or both (you decide)

Selling Products (or services): Products are selected, their quantity chosen, and are included in a cart. Products are purchased using a credit card number (any number is accepted by the system). The quantity of product sold is subtracted from the quantity in stock and added to the quantity sold. Carts are emptied only on payment or by customers.

Product/Service Management: Administrators can create/update/read/delete (crud) new products and services. For example, they can change the stock quantity.

Your functionality: Create a functionality that is specific to your application. It does not have to be something complicated. For instance, if you are selling cars, you may allow users to use an accelerator to hear how each car engine roars up and down.

The system must provide accessibility requirements and provide good usability. The system must be responsive, meaning that it should complete assigned tasks within a reasonable time.
    
2.  Project Description: Describe how your project implements the functionality in the requirements. Diagrams can help a lot here.

Do not forget to include in the Project Description:

-   The functionalities you are going to implement.
    
-   A navigation diagram for your application linked to the screen mockups. This link can be just the name of the mockup (i.e. Mockup1, Mockup2, etc) or an HTML link.
    
-   The information you are going to save in the server (no need to decide how that information will be saved).
    
3.  Comments About the Code: Any comment you may want to add to help understand your code. This is good programming practice.
    
4.  Test Plan: Text describing the tests that will be performed. If an automatic test tool/framework is used (ex: [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/), [Spock](http://spockframework.org/)), the code for the tests can be used.
    
5.  Test Results: Text describing the test results. If an automatic test tool/framework is used, its output can be used.
    
6.  Build Procedures: A step-by-step guide to run your code. You should start telling how to install whatever software you need, then how to download/build your program, and finally how to set up the environment to run it. Imagine that someone installing will just follow these commands (nothing more).
    
7.  Problems: List any major problems you had.
    
8.  Comments: Any comments you wish to add.
