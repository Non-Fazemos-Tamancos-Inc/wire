# Project Milestone 1
The most common use of mockups in software development is to create user interfaces that show the end-user what the software will look like without having to build the software or the underlying functionality. UI mockups can range from very simple hand-drawn screen layouts, through realistic bitmaps, to semi-functional user interfaces developed in a software development tool.
